Other notes:

HealingDefenseArmoryItem was added just hours before deadline, and is therefore not included in SDD.

Jacob refactored GameModel to implement an interface and did therefore gain all code in this class,
which partly was written by others in the group. Look at earlier commits, just before IGameModel, to
get a fair estimation of the contributors to this class.
